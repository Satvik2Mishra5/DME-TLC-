## Introduction

Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design is a cornerstone resource for mechanical engineering students and professionals, providing comprehensive coverage of mechanical engineering design principles and techniques. This repository aims to complement the textbook by offering backend implementations and GUIs for certain chapters, enhancing the learning and understanding of the concepts presented in the book.

## Features
- **Backend Codes**: Backend codes are provided for Chapters 5 (Failures Resulting from Static Loading), 6 (Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading), 7 (Shafts and Shaft Components), 11 (Rolling-Contact Bearings) of Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design 10th Edition.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: GUI implementations are available for selected chapters, offering an interactive learning environment.
- **Modular Structure**: The repository is organized into separate directories for each chapter, ensuring modularity and ease of navigation.
- **Easy Integration**: Codes can be easily integrated into existing projects or used for educational purposes.

## Installation
To get started with using the backend codes and GUIs, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/smrithilokesh/DME-TLC-.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install any necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Explore the Chapters**: Explore the directories corresponding to the chapters you are interested in.

## Usage
1. **Backend Codes**: Use the backend codes provided in each chapter's directory for implementing algorithms, calculations, or simulations described in Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design.
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Run the GUI implementations available in selected chapter directories to interactively visualize and explore concepts covered in the textbook.
